##Yahoo Data Breaches – Incident Report##
Analyst: Jemimah Anna Anil | Breach Years: 2013 & 2014 | Report Date: July 31, 2025

Methodology
Researched publicly documented Yahoo breach details from 2013 and 2014.

Verified timeline using reliable sources (news archives, cybersecurity blogs, breach analysis reports).

Mapped attacker behavior to a 6-step intrusion timeline (Initial Access → Exfiltration).

Identified what went wrong, and what security controls could have prevented each step.

No code execution or breach simulation performed.

Findings
| **Step**             | **What Happened**                        | **What Went Wrong**                     | **Preventive Control**             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1. Initial Access    | Phishing/stolen creds                    | No MFA or credential hygiene            | MFA, security awareness            |
| 2. Exploitation      | Forged cookies, exploited web weaknesses | Weak session controls, poor patching    | Patch mgmt, secure cookie handling |
| 3. Lateral Movement  | Deep access across systems               | No segmentation or RBAC                 | RBAC, network segmentation         |
| 4. Data Discovery    | Accessed PII, hashed passwords           | Weak hashing (SHA-1), unencrypted Q\&As | Bcrypt, encryption                 |
| 5. Data Exfiltration | Stolen quietly, likely sold on dark web  | No DLP, no anomaly detection            | DLP tools, outbound monitoring     |
| 6. Disclosure Delay  | Discovered in 2016, disclosed late       | No IR protocol, poor transparency       | IR policy, timely disclosure       |

Conclusions
Yahoo failed to patch critical systems and used weak security (e.g., SHA-1 hashing).

Lack of internal monitoring, DLP, and incident response prolonged attacker presence.

Timely detection, transparency, and modern security practices could’ve minimized damage.

Code / Configuration
No scripts or configurations used – report based on open-source breach analysis only.
If simulating cookie forgery or hashing attacks, tools like Burp Suite, John the Ripper, or Hashcat could be used in a legal testing environment.

6 step timeline :

Step 1: Initial Access – August 2013 (and separately late 2014)
What happened:
Attackers exploited an unpatched vulnerability in Yahoo's internal systems, possibly through spear-phishing or stolen credentials from a third party.
What went wrong:
Weak internal access controls and a lack of multifactor authentication (MFA).
Prevention:
•	Enforcing MFA across all admin accounts
•	Employee security training (to prevent phishing)
•	Regular third-party credential audits
________________________________________
Step 2: Exploitation of Vulnerabilities
What happened:
Attackers gained admin-level access to Yahoo’s user database by exploiting a weak system and using forged cookies (2014 attack).
What went wrong:
Yahoo stored session management cookies insecurely, allowing attackers to forge authentication without passwords.
Prevention:
•	Secure cookie/session handling
•	Patch management for internal tools
•	Code review and hardening of authentication mechanisms
________________________________________
Step 3: Privilege Escalation & Lateral Movement
What happened:
Attackers moved through Yahoo’s internal systems, gaining deeper access to user information and backup data repositories.
What went wrong:
Flat internal network architecture and insufficient logging allowed attackers to remain undetected for a long period.
Prevention:
•	Role-based access control (RBAC)
•	Segmented networks
•	Real-time logging and alerting
________________________________________Step 4: Data Discovery
What happened:
Attackers accessed massive databases of user account information, including hashed passwords (some with outdated SHA-1), security questions, and recovery info.
What went wrong:
Sensitive data was stored with outdated encryption algorithms (SHA-1 is easily cracked now) and unencrypted security answers.
Prevention:
•	Use of bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing
•	Encryption of all sensitive fields (not just passwords)
•	Remove or anonymize legacy data
________________________________________
Step 5: Data Exfiltration
What happened:
The data was stolen quietly and likely sold on the dark web. Yahoo initially discovered anomalies in 2014 but underestimated the scale.
What went wrong:
•	No effective Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems
•	No alert for large-scale data movement
Prevention:
•	Deploy DLP tools
•	Monitor outbound traffic anomalies
•	Encrypt backups and exports
________________________________________
Step 6: Discovery & Disclosure – 2016 (for both breaches)
What happened:
Despite breaches occurring in 2013 and 2014, Yahoo only publicly disclosed them in 2016 during the Verizon acquisition process.
What went wrong:
•	Delayed detection (years after the breach)
•	Delayed disclosure raised trust and legal issues
•	Regulatory and public backlash
Prevention:
•	Breach detection and alerting systems
•	Crisis communication planning
•	Transparent disclosure protocols
